# NYB Indicators Calculations

## Introduction

The MOU titled, “Development and implementation of an ocean ecosystem monitoring program for New
York Bight”, between NYS DEC and SUNY Stony Brook School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences is to develop an interdisciplinary, multi-trophic level-ocean monitoring program in the New York Bight in order to provide information on the status of New York pelagic resources to managers; and to inform the development of a system of indicators of ecosystem health using existing data and observations collected in the offshore monitoring program in order to better inform decision making regionally and locally.

## This Repository

Within this repository there are three folders:

**1. CalculateIndicators** contains data (exceptions below*) and RScripts used to calculate the Indicators, as well as any Rfunctions used in the calculations.

**2. Datasets** includes the shapefiles that describe the New York Bight area.

**3. Annual Reports** contains 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022 annual reports.

_*Note some data files were too large to be included here: Phytoplankton, Water Temperature, GLORYS reanalysis for Cold Pool and Lobster Thermal Habitat_
