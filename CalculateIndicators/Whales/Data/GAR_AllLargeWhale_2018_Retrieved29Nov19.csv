The whale was towed to the state wildlife area north of Pickering Beach and landed on the beach to decompose above ground. Burial not possible due to the substrate of that area. Prior to that, the whale landed on the small beach area west of the pier so a limited examination took place. Basic morphometrics and genetic samples were collected, as well as photo documentation.The left pectoral fin was missing, and the dorsal fin appeared severed.

An IAP was developed via conference call w/ MERR; Port of Wilmington; Wilmington Fire Dept. As to how to safely and effectively tow the whale and land it. MERR rescue divers performed in water securements, applying straps to tow and lift the whale; Wilmington fire dept. provide 2 vessels to tow the whale out of the berth for access by the crane; P.O.W. used a crane to lift the whale by the straps onto the pavement on docks. The whale was successfully landed at 4:30pm. Incisions were made in ventral area prior to lift to assist with release of pressure from gases. Whale was bloated; tongue exposed during lifting, casual wide spread blood and fluid spray. Whale was entangled with fishing gear, which included orange and white striped bullet buoy w/ #DG9748; and a smaller oval shaped white float; white twisted line; and a smaller section of orange line. Entanglement went through the mouth, w/ bullet buoy at left corner, around pectoral fins, body and tail flukes. Large wound has occurred at lower of mouth with buoy attached. Left pectoral had constriction wounds. Gear documented and sent to David Morin, OLE. Fluke photos sent to Scott Laudry at PCCST, Rosemary Seton at COA> Whale had been previously sighted 2 weeks prior off Iaswich, MA with entanglement in place. She was caught with a weir off of New Brunswick 2 weeks prior to that, without entanglement. Miller environmental was contracted by P.O.W to handle containment and disposal of carcass. It was handled to the Wildlife Conservation area along the banks of the C+D canal (Managed by army corps of engineers) for burial, coordinated with DNREC. Skin, blubber collected.

A team (Michael Moore, Misty Niemeyer) was dispatched the following morning to relocate the carcass from the F/V EZYDUZIT with aerial support from the Provincetown Center for Coastal Studies on board the Skymaster N6263F (Observer: Laura Ganley). Whale was relocated at 1300 by the plane and the vessel arrived on scene at 1340. The whale was floating on its right side. Skull was devoid of soft tissues, the right mandible was still attached but hanging vertically. The left mandible and both flippers were not apparent. There was no skin or blubber evident, but the dorsal muscle appeared intact, albeit dessicated. Viscera protruded on the left side. There were no flukes and the caudal vertebrae had been picked clean. A number of 8-10' blue sharks were present. The animal was entangled in green netting comprised of two types of net - double 1/4"" green braided twine and single 1/8"" green twine. Both types of net measured 6"" stretch and prominent white plastic rings spanned the seam between the two panels. The netting was tightly wrapped across the dorsal aspect across to the genital area on the left side and around the head and wadded up into the throat region in heavily twisted cords of netting. Three strands of line were also found within the gear (3 strand purple 3/8"", 3 strand yellow 3/8"", and 3 strand 5/16"" line). Approximately one cubic meter of netting was recovered from the animal. A sample of muscle was taken for genetics. For more information, see the event report.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Severity of entanglement and general lack of other significant findings on necropsy (animal appeared to have been in good health) suggest that the entanglement directly led to the animal's death.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The report of this whale is thought to be the same one CCS responded to on 7/6/17. IFAW received a report and photos a few days later: Hi Mendy¿ we are still trying to figure out if this one should even have an IFAW # or if it was a resight of the one was seen on 7/8 which was suspected to be the entangled Minke that CCS a empted a response on (WR¿2017¿07). That animal was observed to be ge ng eaten by sharks. We have some images that were sent to CCS. I haven¿t been able to get confirm a on from CCS as to whether or not this is the animal they responded to or if it was a new one. I suspect it is the same carcass and it should not have an IFAW # since it does have a CCS #. Happy to talk by phone if that would be helpful. Later Update: Hi Mendy, So after looking at the info we have and some discussion we don¿t think we have enough to call this a separate animal from WR¿2017¿07. We will reassign our IFAW17¿299 number.

Backhoes were utilized to dig a trench around the animal to ease refloating with the next tide. Throughout the digging the animal appeared to remain stable (determined through respiratory rate and activity). Approximately 15 minutes prior to the animal's death, respirations began to increase.

NEAq spoke with the reporting party Coast Guard Petty Officer Pacearn at 0350hr. RP stating that the CG received a report from a visiting Navy ship docked in the Boston Harbor that a large whale was observed pressed up against their ship with the incoming tide. NEAQ later learned that the Navy ship had been docked just north of the cargo/container ship terminal since the preceding Friday. Photos were not collected at first observation due to darkness. CG agreed to locate animal at first light and to collect photo and send to NEAQ. 0730hr CG collected a photo of the whale floating between Deer Island and Long Island. CG agreed to take NEAQ staff and volunteers out to whale to collect more photos, video, and samples. NEAQ arrived at the floating whale by 1200hr. Images and samples were collected. Due to lack of appropriate landing site and effective disposal plan, carcass was marked with orange spray paint and left floating close to Long Island (42 19.917�N / 70 57.974�W) @1310hr. Within the next two hours, the whale was reported grounded just offshore in shallow water off of the northwest shore of Long Island. NEAq headed to stranding site to assess situation. Carcass could not be accessed safely, so it was left on site. Over the next few days, the carcass drifted throughout Boston Harbor, landing on uninhabited or difficult to access islands for short periods of time to a couple days (see attached map). On Friday October 12, 2012, the whale was high and dry on George�s Island. With assistance from Boston Police Harbor Patrol, and permission from Jack Murray from Massachusetts DCR, NEAq staff were able to conduct a second external exam the whale. Full view of right lateral, the majority of the ventrum, and partial dorsum were observed. Additional photos and samples collected. Again, due to the lack of a disposal plan, the carcass was left on George�s Island. The whale remained on George�s Island until October 14, 2012 when it was reported by DCR to be floating out to sea. October 20, 2012 whale stranded on a rocky shore in Rockport (71 Penzance rd). Again, due to lack of disposal plan, and now the advanced decomposition state, the whale was not further examined by NEAQ and left at this stranding site. Dave Taylor was given permission by Mendy Garron (NOAA) to collect pelvic bones. NEAQ education department was also given permission by Mendy Garron to collect remnants of baleen. Following Hurricane Storm Sandy, the carcass was dislodged and landed 1 mile south of 71 Penzance Rd location. November 1, 2012: Under the direction and organization of Mass Fish & Wildlife Dept, the remaining tissue was removed from bones and buried on sight. The bones were removed from the sight and permission was granted to the Sea Coast Science Center to oversee the cleaning and articulation of the bones.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The animal was repositioned into sternal recumbency on 3/17 to allow for examination of the right side after thorough examination of the left side was completed.The good body condition of the whale, absence of gross evidence of other illness, and the presence of food in its stomach suggests that the death was not due to chronic illness.

Officer Grose said the whale had short, pointy flippers with a white bottom, ventral grooves, a decomposing fluke and was approx. 22-23 feet long.

A team went out to investigate and found a dead minke in a state of advanced decomposition and lying with its upper section twisted. We initially gave it the assession number: COA140822Ba. The team managed to collect numerous bones including skull, right mandible, some 12 vertebrae, 16 ribs, 1 scapula, and a few intervertebral disks. In the interim, bones from the first minke (this record)were retrieved by two of our stranding volunteers on August 23, 2014 who also found that the carcass was now gone in Addison. These included a left mandible, some ribs and vertebrae, and baleen which were strewn all over the beach and brought to COA. Allied Whale staff familiar with whale bones compared the bones from both whales. The left mandible from the first whale matched to the ""second"" whale. This combined with the evidence of the twisted thoracic area on the second whale - cervical and thoracic verts were found from the first whale suggesting this second whale was missing hers and became twisted upon landing in its second location - suggest this is highly likely the same whale. The whale was left at site in Milbridge. Photos from the Milbridge site are included in the photo section.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is tightly wedged in a 'thunder hole' like crevice with its tail stock and flukes jammed under a large overhang, so I was not able to accurately string the measure to its fluke notch. There is no evidence of rope, or other gear on the tail stock. Interesting - the abdomen looks as if the animal 'popped', BUT the margins are rather clean and the flank blubber from this area appears missing, so I do not think it can be ruled out that is was cut (perhaps an attempt to sink it, though now I am just making up a story). The protrusion below the left zygomatic arch is, I believe, the proximate end of the left mandible. The distal end has washed, or been flushed by surge, down the gullet. The right mandible is gone. This is quite conceivable given the position of the critter and the energy it is exposed to. The specimen is mostly inaccessible and absolutely un-retrievable in its present location. I think it has very poor value for an educational field trip - to get a good look at it is a little dangerous and a close vantage only has room for 2-3 people at a time. The hike is about 1.5 hours at a good brisk pace from the preserve parking lot, about 15 or 20 min. walk past the humpback skull. The terrain is rough - loose beach cobble and craggy ledge for the portion along the shore (about half the distance from the parking area).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Samples taken of the lesions indicative of entanglement were sent out to Dr. Dave Rotstein for histopath analyses. On January 4, 2015, we heard that the whale had shifted a few hundred feet to the west of the old Coast Guard Station on Little Cranberry Island (Islesford).

Line was cut on both sides of the mouth in 2014 by the Center for Coastal Studies Disentanglement team in the hopes she would shed it. We found an approximatley 1 meter length of rope with another length of line balled up at one end along monofilament line and two small floats in the mouth of the whale. It was embedded in the upper palete and into the vomer. Tissue had grown over the area. This tissue was sampled and sent out for histopathology. Significant necrotic looking muscle tissue was found in the neck and throat, surrounding the left stylohyoid. There was copious amounts of brown feces in her colon. Unfortunately, she was a Code 4 by the time we could get her towed in and examined/necropsied. We composted the skeleton. In examining the skull, we found the fishing line had cut deeply (27cm) into the bones of the rostrum, completely severing the vomer and bifurcating in both the left and right maxilla. The margins of the laceration are indicative of bone growth indicating healing and that these injuries were not sustained perimortem.","Humpback Whale known as ""Spinnaker"" and its North Atlantic Humpback Whale Catalogue number is: HWC# 8587.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Substantial clotting in thoracic cavity, indicative of pooling of blood on the side the animal was lying on when found dead. Organ decomposition too advanced for further diagnostics.

Animal had been feeding on the biomass of pogies just offshore, with other whales, in shallow water off Hampton-Seabrook-Salisbury beaches. The whale was reported to be entangled in fishing net (suspected pogie net) and thrashing around, by multiple reporting parties. The fisherman that reported the whale, stayed with it while SSC staff called NOAA disentanglement team; David Morin. SSC marine mammal rescue manager Ashley Stokes advised the reporting party against trying to disentangle, but when the animal swam towards his boat, he turned the motor off and waited. The whale approached and he was able to grab the orange float/buoy and with little resistance, the whale was able to swim away, gear free. The fisherman maintained the gear for us, and it was picked up in Hampton that same evening by MA Environmental Police Officer Ryan Lennon, maintained in locked evidence with Lennon, and then transferred to Jason (NOAA OLE). -This whale was later reported dead floating off of Gloucester before landing in Cohasset, MA (New England Aquarium's response territory) on 9/7/18. NEAq responded but logistics (the town, mainly) prevented necropsy. NEAq collected photos, skin sample, and measurement.

Animal was collected same afternoon and transported via lined dumpster to Casella Services (waste facility) in Salem, New Hampshire for limited necropsy following day with New England Aquarium. -PRELIMINARY CAUSE OF DEATH FROM FIELD DETERMINATION: The documented observations and necropsy evidence suggest that the whale was healthy and actively feeding, but had been entangled in rope, minimally including the L oral cavity, caudal peduncle, and possibly the fluke. Samples for histologic evaluation were collected but it is likely that autolysis will prohibit meaningful analysis.

The history and initial external findings revealed whale to be entangled in rope from head to tail and there are corresponding external abrasions and depressions in the areas underlying the rope. There is gross evidence of hemorrhage in the tissue underlying the external lesions, consistent with physical response to entanglement. Based on gross evidence cause of death is presumed to be associated with entanglement, but diagnosis may be modified according to histologic and toxicology evaluation. Histologic evaluation however will likely be confounded in this case due to the level of autolysis associated with minimal 72 hour delay between death and necropsy. -Baleen was collected for educational use at SSC.",NEAQ-18-110-Ba,,,Beach or Land,35,286,Rye,,#NAME?,42.985,actual,-70.7622,actual,GPS,,,,Y,3,Y,,,,,,Y,Suspect,,,,

Necropsy Results: ""Case summary: The most significant finding in this juvenile minke whale was the severe depletion in adipose stores. Combined with the fact that the gastrointestinal tract was largely empty, the whale appeared to have not eaten for a significant duration. This may have been due to premature maternal separation. The mostly likely cause of stranding was weakness due to malnutrition. There were also signs of shock within the lung and mesenteric vessels, which occurred secondarily to becoming stranded on the beach. There was minimal evidence of parasitism observed in this whale, which was confined to the lung and small intestine. The associated lesions were not considered clinical significant. Lung lesions associated with a morbillivirus infection were not observed.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Army Corp of Engineers agreed to pull the whale off of the bow and tow it to their facility in Jersey City, NJ. The Minke Whale was tied off overnight to the dock. The carcass was fresh enough that it remained fully submerged overnight until a team from The Riverhead Foundation, including Kimberly Durham, and The Marine Mammal Stranding Center, including Brandi Biehl, could arrive to perform a necropsy. It was found to be a code 2 at time of necropsy. The weight was accurate plus or minus 200lbs for scale fluctuation. There was severe shredding along the lower mandible that was likely caused by being drug through the water on the ships bow. The organs were exposed at the site of impact with the boat. The necropsy showed evidence to support that the ship strike was the likely cause of death. Evidence included impact trauma (hemorrhaging and edema) that suggested the animal was alive at time of impact. There was also evidence in the stomach that the whale had been eating recently.

The carcass was initially on the bow of a ship, then slid off, and was later reported floating. Carcass was towed to the Army Corps of Engineers base in Port Jersey. Necropsied by staff from MMSC, WHOI, NJAHDL, RFMPR, IFAW, and the Smithsonian Institute. Necropsy Results: ""COMMENTS: The cause of death is confirmed as trauma based on the presence of bone emboli in the lungs. In severe blunt force trauma with skeletal damage, fragments of bone can enter the venous system and travel thru the right heart to lodge in the pulmonary capillary bed. This is a common finding in cattle slaughtered by captive bolt, where then animal is initially stunned while the heart continues to beat for a short period of time prior to death. In peracute bone fractures, often the fracture site cannot be differentiated from post-mortem breakage and sectioning of bone for the purposes of collection. Hemorrhage was not noted in the section of bone examined (Slide 14), however, neither was soft tissue (adipose tissue and marrow) due to post mortem autolysis so the failure to identify hemorrhage is irrelevant. Other interesting findings include degenerative changes in the scapulohumeral joint and mineralization in the kidneys. The cause of neovascularization, dystrophic mineralization and reactive synovitis is likely to be hereditary or the result of previous trauma. These are not indicative of active infectious arthritis. Mineralization in the kidneys is could be secondary to dehydration or a dietary mineral imbalance. Spermatogenic arrest in the gonads could be indicative of seasonal downregulation of sperm production or could be a sign of immature gonads. Spermatogonia were present, indicating that this animal was at least a late juvenile / young adult. There was no evidence of morbillivirus, toxoplasmosis or brucellosis in the sections examined.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Riverhead Foundation, NMFS and PCCS discussed the limited options for the logistics of this case and NMFS requested USCG support for further documentation before sunset - the local station was conducting a SAR at the time so resources were unavailable. The NERSC and Riverhead had plans for conducting nearshore aerial surveys the following morning and were asked to report sightings of the whale. No sightings were made of the whale on 9/29 or 9/30.

Attached are the only photos we have so far. A fisherman that saw it described it as a Mn because it had long pec fins (68 feet) and the entire animal was about 40 feet.
